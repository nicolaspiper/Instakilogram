## [InstaKilogram](instakilogramme.herokuapp.com)

This app is a photo sharing website where one can share science related photos and photos of their lives with their friends. It features the ability to follow others, comment on posts, and like posts as well as comments.

InstaKilogram utilizes a tech stack comprising of React/Redux on the frontend, jquery for ajax calls to the the Ruby-on-Rails backend, which is interacting with a relational database built off of PostgreSQL.

## User Registration and Authentication

Having nearly pixel perfect styling and routing in my opinion I would like to showcase my user registration and authentication MVP. I mimicked Instagram's routing pattern as well, directing someone without an active session to the landing page -having only a sign up form alongside a picture of the mobile app beside it, unique from both the login and sign up pages which only contain their respective forms.

In order to tackle the form I decided to anonymize a general form and use it on all three seperate pages, changing its functionality for each frontend view. 

For your judgement here is a juxtaposition of Instagram and Instakilogram:
